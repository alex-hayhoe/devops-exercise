When transitioning to a production environment, several key changes would be necessary 
to ensure scalability, reliability, and maintainability. 
Introducing Terraform modules would be a fundamental step in this process. 

Furthermore, moving away from running Terraform commands locally in 
Docker containers to implementing infrastructure provisioning within 
a CI/CD pipeline would enhance the deployment process. 

In addition to these changes, several other considerations are 
vital for a production-grade environment. 
Utilizing remote state storage, such as Terraform Cloud or AWS S3, 
enhances collaboration and ensures consistency across distributed teams.
